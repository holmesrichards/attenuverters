# Attenuators build notes

There isn't much to say about building this module. As usual, start with the shortest components (resistors, diodes) and finish with the tallest (headers, electrolytic caps). Notice that the pin header/socket and the Molex header will go on the PCB sides opposite the rest of the components.

Before soldering them, put the 16 pin header and socket together and sandwich them between the front and main PCBs. Use screws, washers, and spacers to secure the two boards together. Once they're aligned and held in place, solder the headers. Definitely do this and check it before soldering the jacks, otherwise getting to the pin socket on the front board to solder it will be next to impossible. Then place the sliders and jacks in their places on the front board, put the panel on top of them, and fasten it down with nuts on several of the jacks. Stick pieces of foam or something like that between the sliders and the panel to keep them in place, turn the assembly over, and solder the sliders and jacks to the PCB.

Finally, solder wires to the toggle switch, secure it to the front panel, and then attach a Molex connector to the wires to connect to the Molex header on the back of the front board. Of course you can leave out the Molex and just solder the wires straight to the PCB if you'd rather.
